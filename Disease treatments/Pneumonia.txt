Get vaccinated. Vaccines are available to prevent some types of pneumonia and the flu. Talk with your doctor about 
getting these shots. The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status 
with your doctor even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.

Make sure children get vaccinated. Doctors recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than age 2 
and for children ages 2 to 5 years who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group
child care center should also get the vaccine. Doctors also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.

Practice good hygiene. To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your
hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Don't smoke. Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.

Keep your immune system strong. Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.
